\subsection{Overview}
The location of the nEDM spectrometer in an accelerator facility necessitates a system to reduce influences of environmental magnetic fields to the experiment. As mentioned in an earlier section [ref, MSR], there is a strong background field of $\approx 350\,\mu$T in the TUCAN area in the TRIUMF Meson Hall. The FEA simulations revealed that such a strong field could saturate the mu-metal layers of MSR, and worsen its shielding performance [ref, 9.4.1]. In addition, there are also occasional field perturbations on the order of $\sim 10\,\mu$T, which may require demagnetization procedures of MSR. 

The Ambient Magnetic-field Compensation (AMC) subsystem will consist of a set of coils and magnetometers to provide static and dynamic magnetic field compensation in the exterior of MSR to ensure the shielding performance of MSR and increase possible  up time of the EDM measurements. This section specifies the key requirements of this subsystem and some developmental works performed in this context.

\subsection{Purposes}

The PSI nEDM experiment also employed a system of surrounding field compensation [Afach2014]. To compare the situations of the PSI nEDM and the TUCAN area in the TRIUMF Meson Hall, and to clarify the requirements in our case, typical numbers to characterize the magnetic environments are listed  in Table \ref{tab:amc_comparaion}. 

One significant difference between the two is the order-of-magnitude stronger static background field in the TUCAN area which is due to the stray field of the TRIUMF cyclotron. As long as this issue is well treated and the function of MSR secured, TUCAN MSR is expected to provide sufficient suppression of the background fluctuations to the order of $\sim10\,$pT in the averaging time of $\sim 100\,$s. 
Therefore, unlike the case of the PSI experiment where the active magnetic field compensation was used during the EDM measurement sequence to achieve required magnetic field stability, the active control field is not necessary during the EDM measurement sequence. 

In both cases, occasional strong magnetic field variations exist. In case of the PSI experiment, neighboring superconducting magnet test facilities were operated in daily bases,  producing magnetic field variations up to $30\,\mu$T. According to [Afach2014],  field variations of this order required a degaussing (or idealization) procedure of the passive shielding. The needs of this procedure, which typically took about 30\,min to an hour, were reduced by the active compensation suppressing them by a factor of $\sim10 $[Afach2014]. In case of TUCAN, the overhead bridge crane was found to produce magnetic field variations on a comparable order. Therefore we should anticipate that such field variations will make degaussing procedures required. Active magnetic field compensation can possibly reduce the needs of degaussing procedures, if it can suppress some of the field variations to the order of $1\,\mu$T or below, it can even make the EDM measurement possible under such field variations.

Based on the above discussions, the purposes of the AMC are 
\begin{itemize}
    \item to provide static magnetic field compensation in order to prevent the background field of $\approx 350\,\mu$T from saturating MSR 
    \item to provide compensation of dynamic magnetic field. Its main target is the strong field variations on the order of $\sim 10\,\mu$T. This will increase potential up time of the EDM measurements. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Requirements}
The key requirement specifications on the performance of AMC are stated below:

\begin{RSenumerate}[resume]
\item    The AMC static magnetic field compensation should reduce the field surrounding MSR such that $|\mathbf{B}|<0.1\,$T in the outermost layer of MSR.
\label{RS:amc_static}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{Rationale:}]  The saturation magnetic induction of mu-metal is about $ 0.7\,$T. We require $|\mathbf{B}|<0.1\,$T  in order to have a large enough safety margin.
    \item[\textbf{Test:}] In defining the geometries of the coils, FEA simulations are essential which include a realistic background field, MSR, and the compensation coils to confirm that the requirement is satisfied. 
    
\end{itemize}
 \item The aimed compensation of the dynamic compensation is a factor of 10 for field variations on the order of $\sim 10\,\mu$T.
 \begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{Rationale:}]  (The threshold of where we need degaussing is not well known, but a factor significant reduction will help, this is also a realistic number)
\end{itemize}

  \item The target of the static and dynamic compensation should be a  volume which contains the parts moved by opening or closing of the door of MSR [ref, figure in MSR section] \label{RS:amc_volume}
 \begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{Rationale:}] So that the parts of MSR moved by opening/closing do not become saturated. This will be necessary for operation as well as construction of MSR. 
    
\end{itemize}
 

\end{RSenumerate}

We are still on the way of the concept design, the hardware requirements are not clarified  on this stage. To list some which are known at this point: 

\begin{RSenumerate}[resume]
\item The structure of AMC should not interfere with other apparatus in the area, according  to the latest layout of the assembly of the EDM apparatusv (December 2019), this volume would be **m x **m x**m 
\item 

\end{RSenumerate}

Some other hardware requirements should include, response time of the system which would constrain the inductance of the coils and switching time of the power supplies, an adequate rate and accuracy for the readout of the magnetometers, etc.. They will be clarified as the concept design proceeds. 





\subsubsection{Status of the concept design}
\subsubsection*{Feasibility of the static compensation}
(FEA simulation of a simple homogeneous background and Helmholtz coil pair compensating it, say that the realistic field map is required for design of the actual system)

\subsubsection*{Recent magnetic field measurements in Meson Hall}
(explain the motivations, show the map and coordinate definition)
\subsubsection*{Characterization of the static background field}
(show the plots, above $\sim$1 m from the floor, the z component is almost constant)
\subsubsection*{Characterization of the field variations caused by the overhead crane}
(Crane variations characterized by sensors fixed at multiple locations
\begin{itemize}
    \item Field variations created by bridge is homogeneous (<1muT/m) and not so large < 10muT
    \item Field near the hook even goes up to 100 $\mu$T for the nearest sensor (**m?)
\end{itemize}
As the variations of the crane is one of the main target of the dynamic compensation, these characterizations will be considered in designing the coils for dynamic compensation.)

\subsection{Timeline}
(aiming to complete concept design by March 2020)



% \subsection{DAQ/AMC Interface Requirements}

% Q1: Will your subsystem be providing a data stream (over some network connection) to the DAQ/controls?  Or will you be providing an analog signal(s) that you want digitized by some DAQ/controls module? 
% If you are providing only a data stream, then you can skip question 2.

% A1: The AMC will provide a data stream


% Q3: Does your subsystem require a digitizer that is referenced to a central atomic clock?

% A3: No. The subsystem acquires magnetic field data and makes response to it of necessary, but it is not required to synchronize this process to an external clock with extreme precision. The status of the system, such as recorded magnetic fields or currents set to coils will be recorded to MIDAS as for the other subsystems, but moderate precision of the absolute time is sufficient for this purpose, too.

% Q4: Does your subsystem have controls or gas handling like equipment?


% Q4.1 If yes does your equipment require PLC-type interlocks to ensure correct/reliable operation?  Ie is there equipment-protection, safety or operational reasons why controls needs to be done with a PLC-type system? Or is it sufficient to have a computer program doing the control?

% A4: The control of the subsystem can be decided later, but seems to be ideal to use EPICS/MIDAS as for the other parts of the experiment. No gas handling like equipment is planned to be included in this  subsystem.

\paragraph*{RS 3.-34}	The AMC shall reduce the external magnetic field to a level comparable to Earth magnetic field, less than 50 muT 
\newline Rationale: 	
%The passive shielding of the MSR can only handle a field of a certain magnitude, so the external field must be compensated.
We do not expect the outer layer of the MSR to saturate (refer to A Sher's calulations to be inserted into this document), however, the manufacturer of the MSR will not certify it's performance for any external field value larger than Earth field
\newline Rationale: 	The 50 muT requirement is Earth’s field, but a smaller target field may be desirable
\paragraph*{RS 3.-35}	The AMC shall be constructed in such a way that it does not prevent access to the MSR. A 'door' as well as a roof lid might be required in the AMC coil cage.
\newline Rationale: 	It will certainly be necessary to enter the MSR throughout the experimental run, so the AMC cannot render this impossible.
\paragraph*{RS 3.-36}	The ambient field of the experimental area shall be mapped and monitored to a precision acceptable to specify the construction of the AMC; 
\newline Rationale: 	It is important to understand the ambient magnetic conditions due to other magnetic equipment prior to running the experiment. ie the maximum DC values and amplitude of AC changes need to be known such that the right power and bandwith/speed of power supplies as well as inductance of coils can be chosen/determined.
\paragraph*{RS 3.-37}	The ambient magnetic field control system shall be developed such that its cost falls within the CFI budget allocation.
\newline Rationale: 	 This is necessary for completion of the experiment.
\paragraph*{RS 3.-38}	Development of the ambient magnetic field control systems shall be completed in the timeframe given by the Level 1 schedule shown in Document-154393. Critically this specifies installation of all hardware by 2021.
\newline Rationale: 	This timeline is necessary to begin data taking in 2021 in order for the TUCAN EDM experiment to remain competitive.

\paragraph*{Requirement:} buck the cyclotron field to a level that fulfills IMEDCO operations conditions
for the MSR (below Earth field) and ensure the outermost layer will not saturate;
\paragraph*{Requirement:}
maybe stabilize the external field in subHz region if that can improve the MSR performance

\subsubsection{Other stuff}

\paragraph*{Open question:} Final conclusion of necessity of dynamic part depends on manufacturer specs, and might
only be accessible once the MSR is installed at TRIUMF and tested

\paragraph*{Baseline design:} A coil cage of three orthogonal ‘merrit coils’ should do the job, but it should be checked that
sufficient orders of magnetic field can be covered by this kind and number of degrees of
freedom
\paragraph*{Design Status:} Simulation and design note needed, maybe tad bit more
R\&D
\paragraph*{Interfaces:} Relation to thermal enclosure, inside or outside? Does their mechanical structure interfere?
